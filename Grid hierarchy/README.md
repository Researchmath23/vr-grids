# Cell hierarchies

These cells include a hieararchy of 1d meshes and the corresponding 2d surface mesh. 
All refinements of the 1d mesh are contained within the center of the 2d surface mesh.

There might be still artifacts in these meshes, this is ongoing work to be resolved soon (Render vector).
