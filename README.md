# C2M2VR-Grids 
Tools and grid generation scripts for creating VR-ready Unity mesh bundles (.vrn archives) starting from 1d neuron 
morphologies stored in the SWC format and retrieved from the publicly available database of neuronal morphologies at 
[NeuroMorpho](http://neuromorpho.org). Bundles include inflated 2d surface meshes, original 2d surface meshes, and refinements of 1d meshes.

<strong>Attention:</strong> Temporarily grids are stored
 [here](https://temple.app.box.com/folder/116445648846) (Comparison of additional points in between branching points or not) and 
[there](https://temple.app.box.com/folder/116203752704) (Full cell geometries with blown up meshes, HINES ordering and 1d grid hierarchies with spline (sub)-sampling)

## HOWTO generate grids

### Prerequisites
Follow installation instructions for *ug4* from [here](https://github.com/ug4/ughub) 
with the plugin *neuro_collection* installed and enabled from [there](https://github.com/NeuroBox/neuro_collection).
For Windows installations a working WSL or Cygwin environment is required to 
run the VR pipeline script (Sh/Bash). Currently a platform independent 
VRL-Studio project is developed and found [here](https://github.com/c2m2/VRL-VRN-Generator).

Optional is the installation of the *NeuroMorpho.org* REST API from [here](https://github.com/NeuroBox3D/neuromorpho)
to retrieve `SWC` files from the database:

`python get_swc.py --name 44-4`

This will retrieve the file 44-4 from *NeuroMorpho.org* database which will subsequently be used in mesh generation.


### Database and cell requirements
Cells will be packaged into a *.vrn* file if and only if all geometries pass the automatic geometry consistency checks.

The 1D cells (SWC) respectively the cell topologies from *NeuroMorpho.org* need to fulfill the following conditions:
1. Cells need to be acyclic, i.e. cycles are neuroanatomically not meaningful and thus disallowed
2. Bifurcations >= 4 branches are not allowed

If any of these conditions are violated the user will be issued an error message during mesh generation.

### Usage
`pipeline_vr.sh -i <INPUT_PATTERN> -o <OUTPUT_FOLDER> -s1 <SEGMENT_LENGTH_1D> [-c <BUNDLE>]
			 [-s2 <SEGMENT_LENGTH_3D>] [-c1 <CREATE_1D>]Â [-c3 <CREATE_3D>] [-d <DEBUG>] [-q <QUIET>]
			 [-m1 <METHOD_1D>] [-m2 <METHOD_3D>] [-a <REMOVE_ATTACHMENTS>] [-v <FOR_VR>]
			 [-p <PRE_SMOOTH>] [-r <REFINEMENT>] [-f <FORCE_SPLIT_EDGE>] [-b <INFLATE_MESH>]`

Basic usage (Single input file and output to NewCell folder):
`./pipeline_vr.sh -i 44-4.CNG_original.swc -o NewCell/`

Note, that the option `-a false` removes the attachments for visualization in ProMesh 
and writes additional meshes with the suffix *_wo_attachments*:
`./pipeline_vr.sh -i 44-4.CNG_original.swc -o NewCell/ -a false`

Note that the option `-c true` will only bundle the meshes into a *.vrn* file.
`./pipeline_vr.sh -i 44-4.CNG_original.swc -o NewCell/ -c true`

Extended usage:
`./pipeline_vr.sh -i 37-4a.original.swc -o NewCells/ -s1 "-1"  -s2 -1 -c1 true -c3 true -m1 min -m2 identity -a true -p true -r true -f false -b false -v true`

This will output the 1d regularization, 1d refinements, blown up meshes in HINES format 
with and without attachment data to the provided folder NewCells (Folder must not 
exist before) The regularization will be done with minimum edge length between 
branching points unless the user specifies an alternative edge length themself
for regularization.

Usually it suffices to keep the default parameters (Which are shown above explicitly) and invoke the following to achieve the same as above:

## Test
A temporary folder to put in cells for checking if they fullfill all prerequisites on the mesh quality.
 If the test cells pass the algorithmic quality checks and the visual quality checks in ProMesh and Unity as well, 
then these will be moved to the main virtual-reality project repository StreamingAssets folder found
 [over here](https://github.com/c2m2/virtual-reality/tree/development/Assets/StreamingAssets/NeuronalDynamics)
Defective cells will be stored in the folder *Defective Cells* as a backup.

Fully working cells can be added to the CI pipeline script test (Travis/Appveyor) to ensure these still work in later revisions of the grid generation.

## Cells 
Currently usable cells (no blowups and no refinements) which should be free from defects
 (These cells are replicated in the main VR project repository 
[here](https://github.com/c2m2/virtual-reality/tree/development/Assets/StreamingAssets/NeuronalDynamics)

## Full Cells (with Blowups and Refinements)
The same as *Cells* above but with blowups and refinements found in *Full Cells*.

## Cylinders 
Cylinders with a length of 100 units, with *varying degree of grid resolution*, radius of cylinder is 1.

### Y-geometries
Two way branches generated from SWC files.

## Defective cells
A collection of previously used cells, which suffer from grid artifacts and other defects. 1d grid hierarchies
contained (Regularly refined 1d grids) and the corresponding 2d surface meshes. Test folder includes grids
used to debug mesh artifacts (Thin dendrites, Twists and False Face Orientation)

## Code
- `pipeline_vr.sh`: The main grid generation pipeline. Generates a hierarchy of 1D
 and 2D surface meshes and inflated 2D surface meshes. HINES ordering of the graph
is ensured. Refinements are generated by sub-sampling the splines defined on the 
points of the original 1D SWC geometry in prescribed arclength by the user or as
the minimum distance between branching points leading to regularized or quasi 
uniform edge length distribution.
- `coarsen.sh`: Grid coarsening based on the 1D SWC mesh without using splines
- `sparse.py`: Matplotlib script to visualize sparsity pattern of 1D graphs
- `edges.py`: Creates plots of edge length statistics (boxplots and histograms)
of the original and regularized 1D meshes.
- `remove_attachments.sh`: Removes attachments if they might not be readable by ProMesh
