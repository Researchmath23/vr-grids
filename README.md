# C2M2VR-Grids 
Grids for VR simulation adn experiments.

## Cylinders
Cylinders with a length of 100 units, with *varying degree of grid resolution*, radius of cylinder is 1.

## Cells
Cells with *varying diameters*, scaled by a factor of 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000.
Currently two cells, CA1 Pyramidal (CA1) and Calretinin (CR).
