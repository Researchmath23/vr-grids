# Full geometries

- 11: 10-6kdv2.CNG from the Smith archive with dendrite diameters scaled by factor 0.1
- 12: 10-6kdv2.CNG from the Smith archive with original dendrite diameters

Each cell contains 4 refinements and two blown up geometry versions with factor of 2 (infix x2) and 4 (infix x4) in addition to the untouched geometry scaleed with factor 1.
