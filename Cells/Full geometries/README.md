# Full geometries

- 11: From the Smith archive, dendrites intersect at soma. Naive treatment by wrapping around a slightly larger soma sphere.
- 12\_a, 13, 14, 15: Regular cells which do not overlap at soma start.

Each cell contains 4 refinements and two blown up geometry versions with factor of 2 (infix scaled\_x2) and 4 (infix scaled\_x4) in addition to the untouched geometry scaled with factor 1.
